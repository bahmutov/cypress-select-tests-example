# cypress-select-tests-example [![Build status][ci-image]][ci-url] [![renovate-app badge][renovate-badge]][renovate-app]

> Example using [cypress-select-tests](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-select-tests) to run only some tests

See [cypress/plugins/index.js](cypress/plugins/index.js). In this test we only allow tests with the string "does" in the title. Thus other tests are automatically skipped.

![one a single test runs](images/one-test.png)

When running in headless mode `npx cypress run` only a single test runs too

```text
  Running: spec.js...    (1 of 1)
picking tests from file cypress/integration/spec.js
found tests
[ [ 'suite', 'works A' ],
  [ 'suite', 'does B' ],
  [ 'suite', 'tests C' ] ]


  suite
    - works A
    âœ“ does B (38ms)
    - tests C


  1 passing (81ms)
  2 pending
```
